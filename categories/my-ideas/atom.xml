    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I  recently saw that on a Samsung Galaxy Y, that users have an option to switch between normal speakers mode or to 5.1 speakers. This is possible as even there are 10 different speakers, everything is heard from our two ears. So if we can simulate the sound effect generated from those speakers, we can add as many as speakers and the head phones will simulate it. No need to get the physical speakers, all you need is the simulation. My idea is to develop an application (as a start an android) that enable user to configure the speaker position and the volume. Our software will simulate the effect through the ear phone. Simple and yet interactive application. We are working on to make it compatible with the standard media player or to be used with any other media player.
Currently we are developing this application and Lets see how far it will go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Few years back blue-tooth was introduced to as a near field communication medium. What if we can use the audio clips to do the same thing?Technically speaking it is just to encode the data stream to a carrier signal and you are done with the encoding part.  For the de-cording little bit of forward error correction might be needed as there can be data losses in the medium. But it is not technically impossible, I would say it is technically simple.</p>

<h2>Possible uses</h2>

<p>If we can develop this as an mobile application most probably as android application there are plenty of uses with that app.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use as a near field communication medium (Like blue-tooth). Difference being instead of sending here the app will play a music. and the receiver will grab it and decode it.</p></li>
<li><p>For rural communication. If a rural village is only covered by land lines a reporter there can send his digital media such as photos, video clips encoded on an audio stream and over the land line with out any complex equipments, and from the receiving end also without any complex expensive hardware user can get the media sent.</p></li>
<li><p>All most all the phones can record audio messages. So users can take data as recorded audio clip, even the handset does not support encoding and decoding.</p></li>
<li><p>Easily communicate over the mobile network. Does not need EDGE or HSDPA or 3G to communicate as well as hardware such as modems.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate in between a computer and a phone with out a data cable or a blue-tooth/infra-red connectivity.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- more -->


<p>This is an application which allows you to play online videos with subtitles. When you browse any video streaming site(such as Youtube, Metacafe, Megamovies, Novamove …. ), this will allow you to play the same video with subtitles. Watch movies, TV series available on other sites with your own specified subtitles.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
More than 15000+ downloads already and 2000+ active daily users. Have a look at the download statistics available on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-grabber/statistics/">Firefox Statistic Dashboard</a>
</div>


<h2>Why Video Sub Grabber?</h2>

<p>People tends to download videos(specially Movies and TV series) just because they want to play them with subtitles. There are plenty of websites which allows users to play movies or TV series online but does not have subtitles. This is where Video Sub Player comes in to play. Video Sub Player will allow you to play those movies with subtitles.</p>

<p>This is why you should choose Video Sub Player instead of any other web playe</p>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Any Video Streaming Site</li>
<li>Can Download the video</li>
<li>No Softwares (executable)</li>
<li>Any subtitle language</li>
<li>Convenient</li>
</ul>


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>When the addon is enabledYou can enable by clicking on its icon situated on the right bottom corner, it will look for videos on the pages you browse. If it found out any matching video on the page it will grab it and open from Video Sub Player. You can then specify the subtitles you want to play the video with. Currently you need to manually specify the subtitlesCheck Limitations section.</p>

<p>Video Sub player is a player I developed and can be found at <a href="http://vsp.ideawide.com/">http://vsp.ideawide.com/</a></p>

<h2>Limitations/Future updates</h2>

<p>Current version is not capable of finding subtitles for a given video, but we are working on to provide that service as well. We  had some issues with some video providers due to cross domain policy and now it is completely solved(Add-on needs to be installed to play any videos due to cross domain policy restriction).</p>

<p>Change log is found <a href="http://ideawide.com/video-sub-grabber-change-log/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>Only few of the providers allow that. We are working on that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Why Video Sub Player?</h2>

<p>This is an online video player that can play any streaming link with added subtitles. No need to download the video just go to the site and play along with a subtitle you specify (or what we suggest).</p>

<p>Since some hosting providers have restricted their access to other servers and the file path to the streaming url is complex, I have developed an Firefox Addon that will do all the hard work for you. Basically when it is enabled it will grab videos on the sites you browse and take you to VideoSub Player. It will also bypass any security restriction opposed to stop cross domain streaming.</p>

    <id>http://www.ideawide.com/download-unlimited</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is Download Unlimited?</h2>

<p>Welcome to Download Unlimited Firefox Add-on homepage. This add-on will allow you to bypass restrictions on files size over the network. Basically it will modify the IP packet request to suit your network packet size and download chunks by chunk allowing you to bypass the file size restriction.If you can understand that you know everything on this page, no need to read further download the addon and enjoy.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
More than 70000+ downloads and over 8000+ active daily users. Have a look at the download statistics available on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-unlimited/statistics/">Firefox Statistic Dashboard</a>
</div>


<h2>Why Download Unlimited?</h2>

<p>Download Unlimited will allow you to download most of the files even there are restrictions to limit file size. Most of the work and educational entity networks are restricted and only able to download files smaller than a certain size. This addon is developed to lift those restrictions and allow users to download any file over the network.</p>

<h3>Here are some of the features of the Download Unlimited</h3>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Any File</li>
<li>Any Operating system</li>
<li>No Softwares (executable)</li>
<li>Support for Video streaming</li>
<li>Convenient</li>
</ul>


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>When the add-on is enabledYou can enable by clicking on its icon situated on the right bottom corner it will look for large files on the pages you browse. If it found out any file that is larger than the limit specified it will try to divide it in to parts and download the file form the network and then put those pieces together to form the original file.</p>

<h2>Limitations/Future updates</h2>

<p>Current version is only capable of assembling and de-assembling parts if the file is restricted. So you might need a download accelerator to grab all the parts of the file. We recommend DownThemAll addon which is a free Firefox download accelerator addon.</p>

<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/">DownThemAll Addon</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that some of the file hosting providers does not allow users to download files by parts or resume the download from the previous location if you pause. If you are downloading files from those hosting providers, you may not be able to download the files as server it self will reject your request. Here are the file hosting providers we tested. If you have a premium account you do not need to worry about any of these.</p>
