##What is Download Unlimited?
Welcome to Download Unlimited Firefox Add-on homepage. This add-on will allow you to bypass restrictions on files size over the network. Basically it will modify the IP packet request to suit your network packet size and download chunks by chunk allowing you to bypass the file size restriction.If you can understand that you know everything on this page, no need to read further download the addon and enjoy.

## Why Download Unlimited?

Download Unlimited will allow you to download most of the files even there are restrictions to limit file size. Most of the work and educational entity networks are restricted and only able to download files smaller than a certain size. This addon is developed to lift those restrictions and allow users to download any file over the network.

###Here are some of the features of the Download Unlimited

* Free
* Any File
* Any Operating system    
* No Softwares (executable)
* Support for Video streaming
* Convenient

## How it works

When the add-on is enabledYou can enable by clicking on its icon situated on the right bottom corner it will look for large files on the pages you browse. If it found out any file that is larger than the limit specified it will try to divide it in to parts and download the file form the network and then put those pieces together to form the original file.


## Limitations/Future updates

Current version is only capable of assembling and de-assembling parts if the file is restricted. So you might need a download accelerator to grab all the parts of the file. We recommend DownThemAll addon which is a free Firefox download accelerator addon.

Keep in mind that some of the file hosting providers does not allow users to download files by parts or resume the download from the previous location if you pause. If you are downloading files from those hosting providers, you may not be able to download the files as server it self will reject your request. Here are the file hosting providers we tested. If you have a premium account you do not need to worry about any of these.
