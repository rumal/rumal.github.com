des: A protocol to send data over audio.
---

##Background
Few years back blue-tooth was introduced to as a near field communication medium. What if we can use the audio clips to do the same thing?Technically speaking it is just to encode the data stream to a carrier signal and you are done with the encoding part.Â  For the de-cording little bit of forward error correction might be needed as there can be data losses in the medium. But it is not technically impossible, I would say it is technically simple.

## Possible uses

If we can develop this as an mobile application most probably as android application there are plenty of uses with that app.
    
  * Use as a near field communication medium (Like blue-tooth). Difference being instead of sending here the app will play a music. and the receiver will grab it and decode it.
	
  * For rural communication. If a rural village is only covered by land lines a reporter there can send his digital media such as photos, video clips encoded on an audio stream and over the land line with out any complex equipments, and from the receiving end also without any complex expensive hardware user can get the media sent.
	
  * All most all the phones can record audio messages. So users can take data as recorded audio clip, even the handset does not support encoding and decoding.

  * Easily communicate over the mobile network. Does not need EDGE or HSDPA or 3G to communicate as well as hardware such as modems.
	
  * Communicate in between a computer and a phone with out a data cable or a blue-tooth/infra-red connectivity.
